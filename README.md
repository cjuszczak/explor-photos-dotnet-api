# Explor.photos ASP.NET Core API

This is a work in progress and does not yet have any features outside of the initial VS project creation.

Explor.photos is my personal playground of sorts for playing with various new frameworks to build my own personal photo gallery. This is a back end for the project built using ASP.NET Core. This is a work in progress and generally only updated time permitting. Currently the back-end work is in progress and the front-end work will start once a sufficient amount of the back-end is available for use.
